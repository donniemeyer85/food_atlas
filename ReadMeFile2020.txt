The objectives of the Atlas are to assemble statistics on food 
environment indicators to stimulate research on the determinants of food 
choices and diet quality, and to provide a spatial overview of a 
community's ability to access healthy food.The Atlas currently includes 
over 280 indicators of the food environment.The year and geographic 
level of the indicators vary to better accommodate data from a variety of 
sources. Some indicators are at the county level while others are at the 
State or regional level.The most recent county-level data are used 
whenever possible. 

This zip file contains multiple spreadsheets that include:

1.  A variable list that includes metadata about all of the variables
that are mapped in the Food Environment Atlas. (VariableList.csv)

2.  CSV file that contains data for each of the Food Environment Atlas
categories. (StateAndCountyData.csv)

3.  County- and State-level supplemental data that were used as the basis
for a number of calculations in the Food Environment Atlas. (SupplementalDataState.csv & SupplementalDataCounty.csv)
